            <p>I'm part of an agile development team within PwC Deals UK, working as a fullstack developer. Although
              this role is part of a full-time placement year within my degree sponsorship, I take on the workload of a
              standard graduate role, using React, Typescript, Bootstrap and SCSS for frontend development, and C# with
              .NET along with Entity Framework and MySQL databases for the backend. I have also became familiar with the
              tools used by the team during development like Postman, Azure DevOps and SQL Server Management Studio.</p>

            <p>In this summer placement I gained valuable experience and insight working in a professional team to
              produce software prototypes as well as gaining experience demoing these prototypes to senior stakeholders
              and members of the team
              in boardroom style meetings. This placement not only taught me how to use the tools and technologies I
              used, but also vastly
              improved my soft skills in a business environment.
